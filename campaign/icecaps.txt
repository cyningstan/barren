CAMPAIGN DESIGN: ICE CAPS


Setting

Crystal node deposits have been discovered in Dapra's polar ice cap. Icy conditions require a whole different set of units to the arid terrain of the rest of the planet. This has reignited the war between Nuvutech and Avuscorp, both of whom have developed units suitable to the terrain.

Hoverbug - the First Landing unit is capable of operating in all terrain.
