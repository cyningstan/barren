# Scenario briefings
briefing Nuvutech You have been assigned to command our forces on Dapra, a promising mining planet. We have also seen some of Avuscorp's ships in the area, so there may be some resistance if they have also discovered the crystal nodes. We have landed an initial force of Combat Droids, Ground Rovers and Hoverbugs near some surface crystal nodes. Your first task is to secure these nodes and await the arrival of mining equipment. We are assured of your competence in this matter, and have further work for you when this task is complete.
briefing Avuscorp Those thieving scoundrels at Nuvutech have their eyes on our newest mining world, Dapra! We must accelerate our efforts to set up on the planet before they get there, and blast them off the face of the planet if they give us any trouble. That's where you come in, commander. The boss likes your military record and thinks you might do better here than sat behind that desk of yours. First off, you need to seize the five crystal nodes at the landing site. We've given you a small force of light units to begin with; expect more later.

# Victory for Nuvutech
victory Nuvutech Well done, commander. With the landing site secured we are free to build our first mining bases in the area and extend our survey further around the planet. Avuscorp will probably continue to give us trouble, so stronger units are on the way to Dapra now. In the mean time, we have a head start and the resources we are gathering here will allow us to maintain our units on the planet instead of having to source all materials off-world. Please stand by for your next assignment.
defeat Avuscorp What's the matter with you? Are your strategic skills getting a bit rusty after all that time in the office? You'd better brush up quickly, as the boss isn't impressed. Nuvutech have started to expand their hold on the planet. The landing site is pretty well defended now, so we're going to have to turn our attention elsewhere. And they know we're coming for them, so they're likely to beef up their forces further. We'll be back in touch when we've figured out what to do. Don't fail us again!

# Victory for Avuscorp
victory Avuscorp Great stuff! The boss is pleased with your progress. Nuvutech thought it would be so easy! Now the juiciest resources at the landing site our ours and we can start laying down mining bases. But our enemy won't give up that easily. Expect them to come at us with bigger guns next time. Let's be ready for them! More combat units are on their way, and we'll look for other areas of the planet to set up on so we can keep one step ahead of Nuvutech.
defeat Nuvutech We are somewhat disappointed in you, commander. It was thought this simple assignment would not pose any difficulty for you. Avuscorp have seized the initiative and will likely increase their hold on Dapra if we do not increase our effectiveness now. They are fortifying the landing site as we speak, so we will have to consider how to halt their advance while we establish our own hold on the world. Stand by for more orders.
