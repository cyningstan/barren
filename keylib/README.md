KEYLIB - a keyboard library for DOS

KEYLIB is a library for reading the keyboard in DOS. It improves upon most compilers' keyboard functions by allowing polling keys by scancode, so that individual keys can be checked for key up/key down status. It does not (yet) support extended keyboards, so e.g. left and right control are considered the same key.

Full documentation for compiling and using the library is contained in the doc folder.
