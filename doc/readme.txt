BARREN PLANET

Thank you for installing Barren Planet! This is a strategy game for
one or two players. It requires MS-DOS and a PC with at least an 8088
processor and CGA graphics. It will also run under DOSBox.

RUNNING ON ORIGINAL HARDWARE

Assuming that you installed the game into its default location of
C:\BARREN, you can run the game with the following sequence of
commands at the C> prompt:

C> cd \barren
C> barren

RUNNING ON DOSBOX

Some DOSBox installations have an easy way to run DOS executables by
right clicking on the icon for BARREN.EXE and selecting "Run with
DOSBox" or similar. If your system doesn't have this facility, you can
type the following sequence of commands within DOSBox:

Z:\> mount c /home/user/msdos
Z:\> c:
C:\> cd barren
C:\BARREN> barren

This example assumes you have installed Barren Planet within a
directory called /home/user/msdos; if you have installed the game
elsewhere then substitute that directory name instead.
