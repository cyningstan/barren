FINITE STATE MACHINE
State Transitions


The FSM is currently a mess. This file describes how the state transitions should work. These decisions should no longer be made by game->turn(). Instead, game->turn() should merely process the game turn details, and leave the states themselves to decide what state should come next.

Some new variables will need to be added to the game/turn objects for the states to be able to make these descisions. Namely:
- briefing acknowledged - array for both players.
- debriefing acknowledged - array for both players.


Description
  Key
    Top Level Headings - current state
    "User input" - selection from menu
    (condition) - conditional execution
    -> do a thing - what to do on input and/or condition
  Only menu options leading to another state are described
  Processing is not described


States

New Game
  "Start game"
    (load game) -> go to [loaded state]
    (new game)
      (human starts) -> go to Briefing
      (computer starts) -> go to Computer Turn
      (pbm starts) -> go to PBM Turn
  "Exit game" -> quit

Briefing
  (briefing already acknowledged) -> go to Report
  "Proceed" -> go to Report
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> quit

Report
  (no report) -> go to Player Turn
  "Done"
    (scenario ended) -> go to Debriefing
    (scenario ongoing) -> go to Player Turn
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> quit

Player Turn
  "Done turn"
    (human opponent) -> go to Briefing
    (computer opponent) -> go to Computer Turn
    (pbm opponent) go to PBM Turn
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> go to Exit Game

Debriefing
  "Acknowledge"
    (more reports) -> go to Briefing
    (final victory)
      (opponent has seen debriefing) -> go to Game Over
      (opponent has not seen debriefing) -> go to Debriefing
    (next scenario)
      (human opponent) -> go to Briefing
      (computer opponent) -> go to Computer Turn
      (pbm opponent) -> go to PBM Turn

Computer Turn
  "Proceed" -> go to Briefing
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> quit

PBM Turn
  "Proceed" -> go to Report
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> quit

End Game
  "New game" -> go to New Game
  "Exit game" -> quit
