Notes

The campaign should be written as if the unit and terrain types of this campaign are the only ones. It should not dwell on the fact that the unit types may change in different campaigns, and should be specific about crystal nodes as being the source of resources and the mining bases being the units that mine them, and that build other units.

New campaigns will be released as expansions, with their own manuals, and can themselves detail what new units and terrain types exist and how to make use of them.
